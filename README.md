# Javascript-Password-Generator

## Description 

This code creates a random password generator that allows the user to select the length of the password, as well as the types of characters to include (uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers). 
The user is prompted for these options and the final password is generated based on their choices, and returned as a string. 
This code can be used to create a more secure password for online accounts and other use cases.
